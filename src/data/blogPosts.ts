<h4>üéØ The Optimal Approach</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start with deep cleaning</strong> - Get your home to baseline cleanliness</li>
<li><strong>Maintain with regular cleaning</strong> - Keep things tidy and manageable</li>
<li><strong>Schedule quarterly deep cleans</strong> - Prevent buildup and maintain standards</li>
<li><strong>Add seasonal deep cleans</strong> - Spring and fall intensive maintenance</li>
</ol>

<h3>DIY vs Professional Services</h3>

<h4>üßπ When to DIY</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regular weekly maintenance</strong> - Manageable ongoing tasks</li>
<li><strong>Small spaces</strong> - Apartments or minimal areas</li>
<li><strong>Light deep cleaning</strong> - When you have time and energy</li>
</ul>

<h4>üë• When to Hire Professionals</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time constraints</strong> - Busy schedules or large homes</li>
<li><strong>Physical limitations</strong> - Health or mobility concerns</li>
<li><strong>Specialized equipment needed</strong> - Carpet cleaning, high windows</li>
